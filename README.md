# Game

A game written in Rust for both Web and Desktop.

This application can be compiled to WebAssembly using [cargo web](https://github.com/koute/cargo-web) as well as any desktop client that supports [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) using the same logic behind the Game, just different graphical Backends.

A preview of the web version can be seen on [my GitHub Pages site](https://mich101mich.github.io/game_rs/).
The Desktop version can be downloaded from the [release](https://github.com/mich101mich/game_rs/releases) section.
